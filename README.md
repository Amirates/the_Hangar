The hangar is beginner friendly 

Multiple small air crafts are stored in the Hangar

There are two classes HomeProject & AirCraft both are public and within the same file

A class is just a blueprint...

See how to add attributes / fields to a class 

See how a constructor works to build Objects

See how methods work with and without parameters
